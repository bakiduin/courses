    <h1> EMBERDDED SYSTEM AND SENSORS </h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> DEFINITION </h2>
    <p>An embedded system is a specialized computer system designed to perform a specific function within a larger system. 
    It's characterized by its dedication to a particular task, often with real-time constraints.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">KEY CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
    <h2>Dedicated Function : </h2>
    <p> Tailored to a specific purpose, like controlling a car engine, operating a washing machine, 
    or regulating a thermostat.  </p>
    <h2>Real-time operation:</h2>
    <p> Requires timely responses to events or inputs, often within strict time limits. </p>
    <h2>Resource Constraints:</h2>
    <p>Limited processing power, memory, and energy consumption to optimize performance and efficiency. </p>
    <h2>Embedded in a Larger System:</h2>
    <p>Integrated into a larger device or system, such as a car, appliance, or industrial equipment.  </p>
    <h2>Reliability and Durability:</h2>
    <p>Designed to operate reliably in harsh environments and for extended periods.</p>

    <h1> SENSORS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> DEFINITION </h2>
    <p>Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical quantities, 
    converting them into electrical signals that can be interpreted by electronic systems.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> KEY CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
    <h2>Physical Quantity Detection: </h2>
    <p>Can measure various physical parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, light intensity, acceleration, and more.  </p>
    <h2>Signal Conversion:</h2>
    <p>Transforms the detected physical quantity into an electrical signal, often analog or digital. </p>
    <h2>Interface Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Can interface with different electronic systems, including microcontrollers, microprocessors, and data acquisition systems.</p>
    <h2>Accuracy and Precision: </h2>
    <p>The ability to measure accurately and consistently.  </p>
    <h2>Sensitivity:</h2>
    <p>The degree to which a sensor responds to changes in the measured quantity.  </p>
    <h2>Response Time: </h2>
    <p>The speed at which a sensor can react to changes in the input signal.  </p>
    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;text-transform:uppercase">The Synergy Between Embedded Systems and Sensors</h2>
    <p>Embedded systems rely on sensors to gather information about their surroundings and make informed decisions. 
    Sensors provide the "eyes and ears" for the system, enabling it to interact with the physical world. For example</p>
    <h2>Smartphones:</h2>
    <p>Use a variety of sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, etc.) 
    to enable features like auto-rotate, gesture recognition, and proximity-based screen dimming.  </p>
    <h2>Automotive Systems: </h2>
    <p>Employ sensors (temperature sensors, pressure sensors, radar sensors, etc.) 
    to monitor engine performance, control braking systems, and assist in autonomous driving.  </p>
    <h2>Industrial Automation: </h2>
    <p>Utilize sensors (temperature sensors, pressure sensors, flow sensors, etc.) 
    to monitor and control manufacturing processes, ensuring quality and efficiency.</p>
